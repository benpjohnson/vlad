== Converting from Capistrano

* 'task' blocks are renamed to 'remote_task'.
* Most variables are the same. See variables.txt for details.
* No +with_command+ / +sudo+ / +via+ wonkiness
* Uses real ssh so env vars and the like are not a problem
  - no +with_env+ as a result.
* Vlad doesn't use ':no_release' or ':primary'.
  - If you have a task that needs to run on only one host from a role,
    you should declare a new role for that host:
    role :master_db, "master.example.com"
    ..and then override the role for the task you want to limit:
    Rake::Task["vlad:migrate"].options[:roles] = :master_db
* The 'host' method can be used to consolidate multiple 'role' calls.
  - host "www.example.com", :app, :web, :db
    specifies a host with three roles.
* migrate_env is now migrate_args.
