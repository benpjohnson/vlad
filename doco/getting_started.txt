== Quick Start for a 1-Server Solution:

=== Setup

* Create a deploy file, usually in "config/deploy.rb":

    set :application, "project"
    set :domain, "example.com"
    set :deploy_to, "/path/to/install"
    set :repository, 'http://svn.example.com/project/branches/stable/'
    
This defaults to using 'svn export' from +repository+, and a single
server for +app+, +db+, and +www+. If you need to tweak these things,
refer to the variable documentation.

* Add the following to your Rakefile:

    require 'vlad'
    Vlad.load

Vlad.load has a lot of flexibility. See the rdoc for full information.

=== Initial Launch

* Run <tt>rake vlad:setup vlad:update vlad:migrate vlad:start</tt>

=== Subsequent Updates:

* <tt>rake vlad:update vlad:migrate vlad:start</tt>

Each step may be run separately.
