== Quick Start for a 1-Server Solution:

=== Setup

* Create a deploy file, usually in "config/deploy.rb":

    set :application, "project"
    set :domain, "example.com"
    set :deploy_to, "/path/to/install"
    set :repository, 'http://svn.example.com/project/branches/stable/'
    
This defaults to user "www", svn from +repository+, and a single
server for +app+, +db+, and +www+. If you need to tweak these things,
refer to the variable documentation.

* Add the following to your Rakefile:

    require 'vlad'
    Vlad.load 'config/deploy.rb'

* <tt>rake vlad:setup</tt>

=== Launch

* <tt>rake vlad:update vlad:migrate vlad:start</tt>
